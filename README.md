# LockncodeCipher

LockncodeCipher is a web-based application built using Flask that allows users to encode and decode text using various phonetic alphabets and cryptographic techniques. The application integrates several encryption methods such as Caesar cipher, Vigenère cipher, Base64 encoding, and AES encryption. The goal of the system is to facilitate secure communication and provide educational tools for learning about different encoding techniques and cryptography.

## Features

- **Phonetic Alphabet Encoding/Decoding**: Supports multiple phonetic alphabets such as NATO, German, Japanese, Russian, and more.
- **Morse Code Encoding/Decoding**: Convert text to Morse code and vice versa.
- **Cryptographic Techniques**:
  - **Caesar Cipher**: Simple substitution cipher for basic encryption.
  - **Vigenère Cipher**: Polyalphabetic cipher for more complex encryption.
  - **Base64 Encoding/Decoding**: For encoding binary data as text.
  - **AES Encryption/Decryption**: Strong encryption method for secure communication.
